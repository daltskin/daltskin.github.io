      <description>Ever since I saw Martin WoodWard&amp;rsquo;s Brian the Build Bunny for Team Foundation Server over 12 years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by creating signals for continuous integration builds. Following on from my last post, where I walk through creating and setting up a GitHub Webhook with Azure Functions, the next logical step was to integrate this to SmartThings for complete home automation.
SmartThings has a new REST API, which I&amp;rsquo;ve created and released a SmartThings NET library, which gives you the ability to interrogate your SmartThings home automation ecosystem entirely using dotnet.</description>

      <title>Home Automation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting/playing with home automation for a while now, specifically SmartThings and their development environment. At first I was overwhelmed by it all as it seemed a steep learning curve, getting to grips with the Groovy IDE and terminology such as device handlers and SmartApps - but now it&amp;rsquo;s a labour of love.
First things first though, home automation is largely pointless, it&amp;rsquo;s un-necessary and will likely cause you more problems that it&amp;rsquo;s worth in the short term.</description>
