      <description>During lockdown I wanted something to do that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve a computer screen as I was spending crazy hours at the keyboard. I&amp;rsquo;ve (literally) home automated the shit out of my house already, so instead, returned to an old childhood hobby. As a kid I loved building and racing Tamiya RC cars, my first one was the entry level Tamiya Falcon, I then worked my way through some of their models with the Tamiya Hotshot being one of my favourites.</description>
