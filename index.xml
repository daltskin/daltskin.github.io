      <description>Pulumi IaaC =&amp;gt; IaaC# (Infrastructure as CSharp) - Deploying Azure bots with Pulumi I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that, until a week ago, I had never heard of Pulumi, but when they recently announced support for .NET - they got my attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked alot with JSON based Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates in the past - but these quickly become complicated to author when you have many different Azure resources.
Terraform offers it&amp;rsquo;s own HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), but whenever I look at any examples a bit of me wants to die - what is this strange syntax.</description>

      <title>Home Automation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting/playing with home automation for a while now, specifically SmartThings and their development environment. At first I was overwhelmed by it all as it seemed a steep learning curve, getting to grips with the Groovy IDE and terminology such as device handlers and SmartApps - but now it&amp;rsquo;s a labour of love.
First things first though, home automation is largely pointless, it&amp;rsquo;s un-necessary and will likely cause you more problems that it&amp;rsquo;s worth in the short term.</description>

      <description>-- I work as a Software Developer Engineer within Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering, helping customers and partners develop solutions based on the Microsoft Azure platform. I&amp;rsquo;m as old as I look, with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience as a Microsoft software developer. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the Intelligent Cloud and creating new experiences using a range of Microsoft technologies. I have a degree from the university of life and once read some books (I also have a real degree, but have learn&amp;rsquo;t far more from real industry experience).</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my online home from https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jamiedalton to here. Moving my site to Hugo using a static content builder will hopefully mean that I can blog more often, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m outside the blogs.msdn.microsoft.com domain I can write and share other technical articles or things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with.
So speaking of which, leads me to my upcoming next post about Home Automation&amp;hellip;</description>
