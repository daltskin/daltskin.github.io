      <description>This week Steve Sanderson blogged again, this time introducing his latest wizardry WebWindow - a lightweight cross-platform webview library for .NET Core.
He also shared the full source code and provided some great examples on what&amp;rsquo;s possible:
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of evenings experimenting with this a bit. Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;super-pre-alpha quality&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty damn awesome.
Docker Using this in conjunction with Docker.DotNet was my first experiment. Rather than bring web content into the project, why not let Docker do the local hosting.</description>

      <title>Pulumi Azure Bot Service</title>

      <description>Pulumi IaaC =&amp;gt; IaaC# (Infrastructure as CSharp) - Deploying Azure bots with Pulumi I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that, until a week ago, I had never heard of Pulumi, but when they recently announced support for .NET - they got my attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked alot with JSON based Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates in the past - but these quickly become complicated to author when you have many different Azure resources.
Whilst Terraform offers it&amp;rsquo;s own HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), that or working with YAML makes a bit of me want to die - the syntax seems we&amp;rsquo;ve gone back an era in computing.</description>

      <title>Home Automation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting/playing with home automation for a while now, specifically SmartThings and their development environment. At first I was overwhelmed by it all as it seemed a steep learning curve, getting to grips with the Groovy IDE and terminology such as device handlers and SmartApps - but now it&amp;rsquo;s a labour of love.
First things first though, home automation is largely pointless, it&amp;rsquo;s un-necessary and will likely cause you more problems that it&amp;rsquo;s worth in the short term.</description>

      <description>-- I work as a Software Developer Engineer within Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering, helping customers and partners develop solutions based on the Microsoft Azure platform.

I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the Intelligent Cloud and creating new experiences using a range of Microsoft technologies. I have a degree from the university of life and once read some books (I also have a real degree, but have learn&amp;rsquo;t far more from real industry experience).</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved my online home from https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jamiedalton to here. Moving my site to Hugo using a static content builder will hopefully mean that I can blog more often, and now that I&amp;rsquo;m outside the blogs.msdn.microsoft.com domain I can write and share other technical articles or things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with.
So speaking of which, leads me to my upcoming next post about Home Automation&amp;hellip;</description>
