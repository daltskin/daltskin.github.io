I work as a Software Developer Engineer within Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering, helping customers and partners develop solutions based on the Microsoft Azure platform. I'm as old as I look, with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience as a Microsoft software developer.  I'm passionate about the Intelligent Cloud and creating new experiences using a range of Microsoft technologies.  I have a degree from the university of life and once read some books (I also have a real degree, but have learn't far more from real industry experience).

My first ever computer was a Spectrum 48k (yep the rubber key version), where I learn't to copy lines of code out of a book to produce non-working games with endless frustration.  Today, I still sometimes experience the same frustration coding, but the debug experience is much better :)

I build stuff mostly in C#, but occassionaly work in other languages such as C, nodejs and python.
